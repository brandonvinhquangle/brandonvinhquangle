# Brandon Vinh Le

## DevOps Engineer | FIXD Automotive, Inc.

I'm a DevOps & Cloud Infrastructure Engineer focused on building resilient, secure, and scalable systems in the cloud. My passion lies in designing clean, automated infrastructure and empowering development teams with reliable CI/CD pipelines and self-service tooling.

I specialize in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) ‚Äî building modular, reusable Terraform and Terragrunt configurations to manage everything from Kubernetes clusters to VPCs and IAM. At OpenText, I led a major cloud migration effort, moving on-prem applications to AWS and replacing manual infrastructure with a fully automated, Terraform-driven setup, orchestrated with Helm and Kubernetes.

I‚Äôve also developed secure back-end APIs for an Authorization Service in Python and Java, and automated deployment pipelines with Jenkins, GitLab CI, and Docker. These efforts have accelerated releases and improved system consistency across environments.

As a Security Advocate, I enforce secure coding and deployment practices using static/dynamic analysis tools, aligned with the OWASP Top 10. I also served as a Scrum Master, helping teams move fast without compromising quality or safety.

I take pride in crafting infrastructure that's modular, version-controlled, and built to scale, whether provisioning cloud-native platforms or optimizing pipelines from code to production.
