# Brandon Vinh Le

## Software Engineer | OpenText

I’m currently a Back-End and DevOps Engineer with a strong foundation in cloud infrastructure, security, and automation. At OpenText, I’ve led the migration of legacy On-Prem products to AWS-based SaaS architectures, leveraging Terraform, Terragrunt, Helm, and Kubernetes to modernize and scale our solutions. I’ve also worked extensively on our authorization service, developing secure API endpoints in Python and Java to manage user access and permissions.

In addition to back-end development, I manage CI/CD automation environments using tools like Jenkins, Rancher, and Docker, ensuring streamlined deployments and high system availability. As a Security Advocate, I’ve conducted static and dynamic code analyses, audits, and aligned engineering efforts with the OWASP Top 10, reinforcing security from development to deployment.

With a background in Agile practices and experience as a Scrum Master, I’m passionate about building efficient engineering teams, writing clean, secure code, and delivering products that scale.
